### 프로젝트 소개
**ThreatLens - Cybersecurity Anomaly Detection Using Web Log Analysis**

ThreatLens is a cutting-edge project that combines data analysis and cybersecurity to detect and analyze abnormal access patterns in web logs. By utilizing real-world web log datasets from Kaggle, this project aims to identify anomalies such as unauthorized access attempts, abnormal traffic patterns, and potential threats based on IP addresses, user activity, and geolocation data.

**ThreatLens will give you a Powerful Strength**

1. To develop a machine learning model that can classify web traffic as normal or abnormal with high accuracy.
2. To provide insights into connection trends, including country-wise access patterns and suspicious behavior.
3. To enhance cybersecurity strategies by identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities in real-time.

This project has the potential to be expanded into a real-time anomaly detection system using live log data. Future plans include integrating with security monitoring systems to automate threat identification and response.
